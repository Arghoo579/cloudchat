Aerochat
========

Very minimalistic chat application **that logs everything**. It runs on top of
google appengine's channel, and uses AngularJS and Bootstrap for asynchronous
Javascript and formatting.

Feel free to take pieces of code, but I won't support any new feature. The
purpose of this is to prove a point about MapReduce and unstructured data,
generated by decentralised systems. Don't ask.
